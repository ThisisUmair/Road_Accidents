The dataset used in this project originates from a publicly available Kaggle dataset that compiles over three million traffic accident records across the contiguous United States. The data is sourced from multiple real-time traffic APIs, including MapQuest, Bing, and other transportation data providers. It includes detailed information on location, time, weather conditions, road attributes, accident severity, and duration. The dataset is continuously updated and is widely used for research in transportation analytics, traffic forecasting, and roadway safety optimization.
